										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ADV160 is now equipped with a new generation 157cc, 4-Valve, Liquid-Cooled, eSP+ Engine, offering advanced technology with 4-valve mechanism and low friction technologies to provide excellent power output and environmental performance (Fuel Efficient). It delivers a maximum power of 11.8 kW @ 8,500 rpm and a top torque of 14.7 Nm @ 6,500 rpm, which proves more than enough for a reliable ride that takes you from daily commuting to leisure trips.</p>
<p>The ADV160 also comes packed with exciting features from riding safety to everyday convenience.</p>
<p>One is the new<strong> Honda Selectable Torque Control (HSTC)</strong>, an advanced feature that helps balance the work of the wheel rotation. This prevents the slipping of the rear tires, especially on wet and slippery roads. Also set to prevent wheel locking and increase stability in case of sudden braking is the <strong>Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) with Wavy Disc Brakes</strong>. The system provides better braking ability as well as an aggressive look. Also, for long-distance riders, the new <strong>USB charging port</strong> is a convenient addition to this latest model.</p>
<p>The ADV160 is available in three color variants: <strong>Matte Gunpowder Black Metallic, Matte Solar Red Metallic, and Matte Pearl Crater White</strong> with a suggested retail price of <strong>Php</strong><strong> 166,900.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The AirBlade160 lives up to its name by allowing you to slice through the wind while speeding on the new generation 157cc, 4-Valve, eSP+ engine. It’s the model’s star upgrade that generates peak power of 11.2kW @ 8,000rpm and top torque of 14.6Nm @ 6,500rpm, which proves more than enough in making your way through city traffic or going full throttle in long drives.</p>
<p>The AirBlade160 also comes with a full range of essential features and technologies developed to make every ride safe and secure.</p>
<p>The Anti-lock Braking System (ABS), for instance, prevents wheel locking and increases stability, especially in case of sudden braking or when traveling on wet slippery roads. There’s also the Idling Stop System (ISS) that automatically switches off the engine after three seconds of being stationary. This reduces fuel consumption and increases efficiency alongside the engine’s economical fuel consumption of 47.5km/L, based on World Motorcycle Test Cycle Method. The engine automatically turns on again once the throttle is rotated, without having to restart.</p>
